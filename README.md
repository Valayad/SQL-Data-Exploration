# üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement
> Danny aims to leverage customer data to gain valuable insights into their behavior, preferences, and loyalty. Specifically, he seeks to understand:

- Visiting patterns and frequency
- Total spend and average transaction value
- Favorite menu items and purchasing habits

> By gaining a deeper understanding of his customers, Danny plans to enhance their experience through personalized offerings and targeted marketing initiatives. Furthermore, these insights will inform his decision on expanding the existing customer loyalty program.

> To facilitate this analysis, Danny has provided a sample dataset, which will be used to develop fully functional SQL queries. These queries will enable Danny's team to easily inspect the data and gain actionable insights without requiring extensive¬†SQL¬†knowledge.

# ‚úíÔ∏è Case Study Questions
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

## Bonus Questions
> Danny also seeks to understand the ranking of customer products, with a specific requirement: he only wants to rank products purchased by loyalty program members. For non-member purchases, he expects the ranking values to be null.

In other words, Danny wants to:

- Rank products based on purchase frequency and revenue generated
- Exclude non-member purchases from the ranking
- Display null ranking values for non-member purchases

This will enable Danny to gain insights into the purchasing behavior of his loyalty program members and tailor his marketing efforts¬†accordingly

## 1. Total amount spent by each customer

```sql
    --Using Joins
        SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS [Amount Spent]
        FROM sales s
        LEFT JOIN menu m
        ON m.product_id = s.product_id
        GROUP BY s.customer_id

    --Alternatively - Using Correlated Subquery
        SELECT  DISTINCT  s1.customer_id, 
                (SELECT SUM(m.price)
                FROM menu m, sales s2
                WHERE s1.customer_id = s2.customer_id AND s2.product_id = m.product_id) AS [Amount Spent]
        FROM sales s1

    --Alternatively - Using Window Functions
        SELECT DISTINCT s.customer_id,
                SUM(m.price) OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id) AS [Amount Spent]
        FROM sales s
        LEFT JOIN menu m
        ON m.product_id = s.product_id
        ORDER BY [Amount Spent] DESC
```

## 2. Days each customer visited the restaurant

    --Using Nested subquery
        SELECT s.customer_id, 
               COUNT(order_date)  AS [Number of Days]
        FROM sales s

        ORDER BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
```
## 4. Most purchased item and number of times it was purchased

```sql
    --Using Window Functions
        SELECT sq.product_name,sq.[Number of Orders], RANK() OVER(ORDER BY sq.[Number of Orders] DESC) AS Rank
        FROM

             FROM sales s
             LEFT JOIN menu m
             ON s.product_id = m.product_id) AS sq

    --Using Correlated Subquery
        SELECT *, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY sq.[Number of Orders] DESC) AS Rank  
        FROM    
            (SELECT  m.product_name,
